# Artificial intelligence for non majority lecture(Second semester of 2020)
- Practices and assignments while taking a class called artificial intelligence for non-majors.
- NumPy basics, linear regression, KNN classification.

## 1.Numpy basics
- Learn to use Python's NumPy package.
- Practice [Codes](https://github.com/young3984/Artificial_intelligence_for_non_majority_lecture/tree/master/numpy%EA%B8%B0%EC%B4%88).

## 2. Linear regression
- Practice a simple linear regression example. [[Codes]](https://github.com/young3984/Artificial_intelligence_for_non_majority_lecture/tree/master/Linear%20regression/Practice)
- Midterms select topics to be linearized, write reports, and submit them. 
  - I selected a topic on whether there is a relationship between age and happiness and performed linear regression on it. [[Codes]](https://github.com/young3984/Artificial_intelligence_for_non_majority_lecture/blob/master/Linear%20regression/Midterm%20exam/Report.pdf)
    - Result

    - Please check the [report](https://github.com/young3984/Artificial_intelligence_for_non_majority_lecture/blob/master/Linear%20regression/Midterm%20exam/Report.pdf) for detailed process and conclusion.

## 3. KNN Classification
- Practice a simple KNN Classification example.[[Code]](https://github.com/young3984/Artificial_intelligence_for_non_majority_lecture/tree/master/KNN/Practice)
- The final exam selects a topic for KNN classification, writes and submits a report.
  - Setting the topic of classifying fruits using sweet ingredients. [[Codes]](https://github.com/young3984/Artificial_intelligence_for_non_majority_lecture/tree/master/KNN/Final%20exam)
      - Result
